## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Components**

#### **Python ML Engine (`apps/api/ai/recommendation_engine.py`)**
```python
def generate_ai_explanation(activity, user_profile, decision_factors=None):
    """
    Generate human-readable explanation for activity recommendation
    """
    explanations = []
    
    # Interest-based explanation
    if user_interests and activity_types:
        matching_interests = find_matching_interests(user_interests, activity_types)
        if matching_interests:
            explanations.append(f"because you're interested in {matching_interests}")
    
    # Rating-based explanation
    if activity_rating >= 4.0:
        explanations.append(f"it's highly rated with {activity_rating:.1f} stars")
    
    # Budget-based explanation
    if activity_price <= user_budget:
        explanations.append(f"it fits your {budget_level} preferences")
    
    return combine_explanations(activity_name, explanations)
```

#### **TypeScript Service (`apps/api/src/services/ai_explanation_service.ts`)**
```typescript
export class AIExplanationService {
  async generateExplanation(request: AIExplanationRequest): Promise<string> {
    // Call Python engine via subprocess
    const explanation = await this.callPythonEngine(inputData);
    return explanation;
  }
  
  async generateItinerarySummary(request: ItinerarySummaryRequest): Promise<Summary> {
    // Generate itinerary-level summary
    const summary = await this.callPythonEngine(inputData);
    return summary;
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Components**

#### **AI Explanation Tooltip (`apps/web/components/AIExplanationTooltip.tsx`)**
```typescript
export function AIExplanationTooltip({ activity, userProfile, decisionFactors }) {
  const [explanation, setExplanation] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  const fetchExplanation = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/ai/explain', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ activity, userProfile, decisionFactors })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    setExplanation(data.explanation);
  };
  
  return (
    <TooltipProvider>
      <Tooltip>
        <TooltipTrigger onClick={fetchExplanation}>
          <Info className="w-4 h-4" />
        </TooltipTrigger>
        <TooltipContent>
          <div>ü§ñ AI Recommendation</div>
          <div>{explanation || 'Click to see why we recommended this'}</div>
        </TooltipContent>
      </Tooltip>
    </TooltipProvider>
  );
}
```

#### **Itinerary Summary (`apps/web/components/ItinerarySummary.tsx`)**
```typescript
export function ItinerarySummary({ userProfile, destination, totalActivities }) {
  const [summary, setSummary] = useState<SummaryData | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchSummary();
  }, [userProfile, destination, totalActivities]);
  
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>ü§ñ How your itinerary was built</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div>Optimized for: {summary?.optimized_for.join(', ')}</div>
        <div>Based on: {summary?.based_on.join(', ')}</div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
