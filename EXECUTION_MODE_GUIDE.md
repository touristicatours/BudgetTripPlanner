- Real-time status display
- Location permission handling
- Automatic updates and polling
- Quick action buttons

## Real-Time Data Flow

### 1. Location Updates
```
User Location â†’ Browser Geolocation â†’ Execution Service â†’ Real-time Status â†’ UI Update
```

### 2. Delay Detection
```
Location Update â†’ Travel Time Calculation â†’ Delay Detection â†’ Optimization Trigger â†’ Notification
```

### 3. Activity Completion
```
Location Near Activity â†’ Distance Check â†’ Completion Detection â†’ Progress Update â†’ Next Activity
```

## Smart Optimization Logic

### Delay Thresholds
- **Minor Delay (5-15 min)**: Show warning, suggest faster route
- **Moderate Delay (15-30 min)**: Suggest activity shortening
- **Major Delay (30+ min)**: Trigger full re-optimization

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Skip Low-Priority Activities**: Remove non-essential items
2. **Shorten Visit Times**: Reduce duration of flexible activities
3. **Reorder Activities**: Move time-sensitive items earlier
4. **Alternative Routes**: Suggest faster transportation options

### Context-Aware Decisions
- **Weather Impact**: Skip outdoor activities in bad weather
- **Closure Alerts**: Find nearby alternatives for closed venues
- **Wait Times**: Adjust timing based on current busy levels
- **Transportation**: Choose fastest available mode
